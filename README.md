# NLP-Bert-project-Intrusion-detection-
Intrusion detection Using the NLP Bert tool in python with limited source of dataset
For this project I am just trying and get useto with the NLP tools Bert and how well i can utilsed this tool with it's max capability.

One of the challenging task for this project is to run the project with very limited sucre of dataset.

the machine learining NLP model will able to classified in binary manner is their any intrusion in the system.

This NLP model is able to achinve around 61% prediction accuracy. 
However still their are scope of improvment and the dataset is also biased towards the True values of intrusion in system, 
so maybe by adjusting the model weight thier mightbe improvemnet.
